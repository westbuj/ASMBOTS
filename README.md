# ASMBOTS
Source code for the original ASMBOTs. I released a few versions of ASMBOTs for Android. The source code here is the Soccer Bot version.

Some pirate sites still have the APK. I did not keep my playstore going, so it is not availble there.

Highlights of this code is implementation of virtual CPU's with assembly language interface.

Sound, images, and help files are included. Orginal development environment was eclipse (for Android).

The Story of asmBots(tm)
Citizens of the Galaxy! The end of War and poverty is upon us. The Prodigal Devourers are extinct and the Shared Blessings of the galaxy are once again, ours.

With the end of the Great Abstracted War, the Union of Empathy and Quintessence designated an enormous amount of military robots as surplus. The Union authorized demilitarization and re-utilization of many robots and other surplus equipment.

The Coalition for Expanded Knowledge (an official Public Trust recognized by the Union), constructed a Robot Proving Ground on Imp (a large satellite of the planet Fomalhaut b).

All magnanimous Citizens of the Galaxy are welcome to use the facilities on Imp.
