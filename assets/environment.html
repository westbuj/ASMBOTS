The robots running your code physically exist on the natural satellite known as Imp. <BR><BR>
With its numerous production and test arenas, This moon is affectionately known as the 'Proving Grounds.'  <BR><BR>
Each arena has a field and a mainframe computer. An official field is 500 feet wide and 1000 feet tall.<BR><BR>
The mainframe controls the game. The mainframe will transmit a view of the action to your access device.<BR><BR>
The mainframe can also attach to each robot allowing you to debug and edit your code while the game is playing. Through the mainframe you can play, pause, and code.
<BR><BR>
The mainframe can <i>step</i> the game. When stepping, the game pauses after each robot has executed one line of code.
<BR><BR>
In a test arena, the mainframe can also update each robot's code in real-time. This is how you develop your team of robots!<BR><BR>
While in a game, touch your access device, to display the mainframe control panel. With the mainframe control panel, you can adjust the game speed, pause or play the game (step or run), select the robot being developed, and bring up a robot's code.<BR><BR>
