	Citizens of the Galaxy! The end of War and poverty is upon us. The Prodigal Devourers are extinct and the Shared Blessings of the galaxy are once again, ours. 
	<BR><BR>With the end of the Great Abstracted War, the Union of Empathy and Quintessence designated an enormous amount of military robots as surplus. The Union authorized demilitarization and re-utilization of many robots and other surplus equipment. 
	<BR><BR>The Coalition for Expanded Knowledge (an official Public Trust recognized by the Union), constructed a Robot Proving Ground on Imp (a large satellite of the planet Fomalhaut b). 
	<BR><BR> All magnanimous Citizens of the Galaxy are welcome to use the facilities on Imp.
